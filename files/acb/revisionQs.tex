\def\revRanGTP {
\textbf{The Nucleus and Nuclear Transport}\\[1em]
Describe the \textbf{changes in the structure of importin-$\beta$} upon binding RanGTP and how this supports \textbf{directional nuclear transport}.\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Outline the \textbf{major functions and structures of the cell nucleus} with respect to the \textbf{Nuclear Pore Complex}  
    \item Outline the \textbf{principal processes} involving nucleic acid (DNA, RNA) that occur inside the nucleus (NPC transport).
    \item give specific examples of \textbf{experiments, where gene expression is regulated.}
\end{itemize}
}

\def\revHistones {
\textbf{Genome \& Nuclear Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chromatin organisation
    \item Histones are post translationally \textbf{(PTMs)}modified. What type of modifications occur, and what are their functions? 
    \item Chromatin remodeling ...
    \item Order by major classes of \textbf{molecular chaperones})

\end{itemize}
}
\def\revNucleosome {
\textbf{Genome \& Nuclear Architecture}\\[1em]
Describe the structure and composition of the nucleosome. Identify and explain the changes that occur to nucleosomes via the action of co-activators and how these changes stimulate transcription?
}
\def\revPolymerase {
\textbf{Transcription / gene regulation}\\[1em]
On its own, RNA Polymerase II cannot produce an RNA. Why not?
\begin{itemize}
    \item RNA Polymerases
    \item give specific examples of \textbf{experiments, where Transcription is regulation.}

\end{itemize}
