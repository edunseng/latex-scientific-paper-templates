@book{Bayot2022,
   abstract = {Acid-fast bacteria, also known as acid-fast bacilli or simply AFB, are a group of bacteria sharing the characteristic of acid fastness. Acid fastness is a physical property that gives a bacterium the ability to resist decolorization by acids during staining procedures. This means that once the bacterium is stained, it cannot be decolorized using acids routinely used in the process. This important and unique feature of certain bacteria gives the ability to classify and detect them using relatively easy laboratory procedures such as microscopy. Bacteria displaying acid fastness include: 1. Genus Mycobacterium – M. leprae, M. tuberculosis, M. smegmatis, M. Avium complex, M. kansasii. 2. Genus Nocardia – N. brasiliensis, N. cyriacigeorgica, N. farcinica, and N. nova. Acid fastness can also be attributed to other structures not classified as bacteria. These include: 1. Bacterial endospores. 2. Head of sperm. 3. Cryptosporidium parvum. 4. Isospora belli. 5. Cyclospora cayetanensis. 6. Taenia saginata eggs. 7. Hydatid cysts. 8. Sarcocystis. 9. Nuclear inclusion bodies in lead poisoning. Even though acid fastness can be attributed to many different bacteria, correlation with history makes it a fairly unique characteristic of M. tuberculosis in clinical practice. This makes acid-fast staining sensitive and specific, provided clinical correlation is part of the equation. This writing will focus on the acid-fast bacteria M. tuberculosis. The diagnosis of M. tuberculosis using this characteristic is referred to as TB microscopy, acid-fast smear microscopy, and direct sputum near microscopy. Even though the use of highly advanced molecular diagnostic tests has come into play, the value of this staining technique cannot be overstated, especially for low and middle-income countries.},

@article{Azadi2018,
   abstract = {© 2018 Azadi et al. Background: Tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases that has claimed its victims throughout much of known human history. With Koch's discovery of the tubercle bacillus as the etiologic agent of the disease, his sanitary and hygienic measures, which were based on his discovery and the development of a vaccine against tuberculosis by Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin in 1921, an attenuated Mycobacterium bovis strain, bacilli Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and the discovery of the first antibiotic against tuberculosis, streptomycin by Selman Waksman in 1943, soon led to the opinion that appropriate control measures had become available for tuberculosis and it had been assumed that the disease could ultimately be eradicated. The emergence of resistant strains of this bacteria and widespread distribution of the disease in the world, and the emergence of the AIDS epidemic destroyed any possibility of global control of tuberculosis in the foreseeable future. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to highlight the current scientific literature on mycobacterial infections and provide an overview on the laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis and non-tuberculosis infections based on conventional phenotypic and modern molecular assays. Method: In this study, a number of 65 papers comprising 20 reviews, 9 case reports, and 36 original research in association with mycobacteriosis and the laboratory diagnosis of mycobacterial infections, were reviewed. Results: Based on our analysis on the published documents methods applied for the laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis are continually assessed and developed in order to achieve more rapid, less expensive, and accurate results. Acid-fast staining and culture for mycobacteria remain at the core of any diagnostic algorithm with the sensitivity of 20-70\% and specificity of 95-98\% for AFB microscopy and the sensitivity of 95\% and the specificity of 98\% for culture based diagnosis. Following growth in culture, molecular tests such as nucleic acid hybridization probes and DNA sequencing may be used for definitive species identification. Nucleic acid amplification methods provide the means for direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in respiratory specimens without the prerequisite to isolate or culture the organism, leading to more rapid diagnosis and better patient care. Conclusion: As the researchers in a developing country, we strongly believe that despite significant advances in laboratory capacity, in many countries reliable confirmation of suspected mycobacterial diseases is hindered by a lack of knowledge on proper standardized methods, sufficient funds, suitably trained staff and laboratory supplies.},
