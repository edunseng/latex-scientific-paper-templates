   abstract = {The nuclear pore complex (NPC) acts as a selective gate that mediates the bidirectional transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. 'Natively unfolded' nucleoporins (Nups) with domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats form the selective permeability barrier and provide binding sites for mobile transport receptors in the NPC. Understanding the structure and function of the FG-Nups barrier under real-time trafficking conditions is still a formidable challenge due to the dynamic nature of a channeled membranous environment. Recently, we have shown that three-dimensional (3D) density maps of transient interactions between the FG-Nups barrier and a cargo-free or a cargo-bound transport receptor in native NPCs can be obtained by an advanced single-molecule fluorescence microscopy approach. Moreover, we found that these interaction sites are spatially clustered into distinct groups in the periphery around a central axial channel with a diameter of approximately 10-20 nm in the NPC. The 3D distribution of interaction sites may indicate some native properties of the FG-Nups barrier. Here we speculate that the selective permeability barrier in the NPC could be formed by clustered FG-Nups. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.},

@article{npc_transport,
   abstract = {Internal membrane bound structures sequester all genetic material in eukaryotic cells. The most prominent of these structures is the nucleus, which is bounded by a double membrane termed the nuclear envelope (NE). Though this NE separates the nucleoplasm and genetic material within the nucleus from the surrounding cytoplasm, it is studded throughout with portals called nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The NPC is a highly selective, bidirectional transporter for a tremendous range of protein and ribonucleoprotein cargoes. All the while the NPC must prevent the passage of nonspecific macromolecules, yet allow the free diffusion of water, sugars, and ions. These many types of nuclear transport are regulated at multiple stages, and the NPC carries binding sites for many of the proteins that modulate and modify the cargoes as they pass across the NE. Assembly, maintenance, and repair of the NPC must somehow occur while maintaining the integrity of the NE. Finally, the NPC appears to be an anchor for localization of many nuclear processes, including gene activation and cell cycle regulation. All these requirements demonstrate the complex design of the NPC and the integral role it plays in key cellular processes.},
