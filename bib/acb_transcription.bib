   abstract = {Transcription is a highly regulated process that supplies living cells with coding and non-coding RNA molecules. Failure to properly regulate transcription is associated with human pathologies, including cancers. RNA polymerase II is the enzyme complex that synthesizes messenger RNAs that are then translated into proteins. In spite of its complexity, RNA polymerase requires a plethora of general transcription factors to be recruited to the transcription start site as part of a large transcription pre-initiation complex, and to help it gain access to the transcribed strand of the DNA. This chapter reviews the structure and function of these eukaryotic transcription pre-initiation complexes, with a particular emphasis on two of its constituents, the multisubunit complexes TFIID and TFIIH. We also compare the overall architecture of the RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex with those of RNA polymerases I and III, involved in transcription of ribosomal RNA and non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs and snRNAs, and discuss the general, conserved features that are applicable to all eukaryotic RNA polymeraseÂ systems.},

abstract = {Transcription initiation on protein-encoding genes represents a major control point for gene expression in eukaryotes, and is mediated by RNA polymerase II and a surprisingly complex array of general initiation factors (TFIIA, -B, -D, E, -F and -H) that are highly conserved from yeast to man. Elucidation of structural and functional features of these factors on model promoters has revealed insights into biochemical mechanisms and provides a basis for understanding their regulation on diverse promoters by gene- and cell-specific activators.}

   abstract = {RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes all protein-coding genes and many noncoding RNAs in eukaryotic genomes. Although Pol II is a complex, 12-subunit enzyme, it lacks the ability to initiate transcription and cannot consistently transcribe through long DNA sequences. To execute these essential functions, an array of proteins and protein complexes interact with Pol II to regulate its activity. In this review, we detail the structure and mechanism of over a dozen factors that govern Pol II initiation (e.g., TFIID, TFIIH, and Mediator), pausing, and elongation (e.g., DSIF, NELF, PAF, and P-TEFb). The structural basis for Pol II transcription regulation has advanced rapidly in the past decade, largely due to technological innovations in cryoelectron microscopy. Here, we summarize a wealth of structural and functional data that have enabled a deeper understanding of Pol II transcription mechanisms; we also highlight mechanistic questions that remain unanswered or controversial.},
